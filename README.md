# CreateNewFile-Alfred-Workflow
This workflow allows you to quickly create new files directly in Finder using Alfred.

## TLDR
Keyword "new" followed by a filename (optionally add an extension).

## Usage
1. Open the folder in Finder where you want to create a new file.
2. Activate Alfred and type `new`, followed by a space.
3. Enter the desired filename. For example, entering `test.html` will create a new file named "test.html" in the current folder. If you do not specify an extension, the file will be created with a `.txt` extension by default.

Your new file will be created instantly in the current directory.
